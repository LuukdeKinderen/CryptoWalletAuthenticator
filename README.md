# CryptoWalletAuthenticator
This is a project where I created an authenticator that will authenticate users based on their crypto wallet address. It serves as a replacement for a regular username and password login. This repository is for a school project where I researched an "emerging trend". 

## How to use
### Install MetaMask
To use this application, you must have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/) installed as a browser extension. If you do not have this you will get an error.
